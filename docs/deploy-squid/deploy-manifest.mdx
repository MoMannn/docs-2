# Deployment manifest

The deployment manifest is named `squid.yaml` by convention. The manifest defines how the squid should be built, customized and scaled during the deployment to Aquarium. It is used together with [`sqd deploy`](/squid-cli/deploy) to deploy or update an existing squid version.

With the introduction of the deployment manifest the addons (`postgres`) and the API services (`api`) become optional. This allows flexible deployment configuration for analytic use-cases (e.g. transform and write to s3 or BigQuery).
 
## Header

The manifest header defines the squid metadata

| Field                    |      Archive endpoint                         |  
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| `manifestVersion`        | Only `subsquid.io/v0.1` is currently supported     |
| `name` | A globally unique squid name. Can only contain lowercase Latin letters (`a-z`) and a dash (`-`). | 
| `version`                 | Squid version. **Must be an integer**. A squid deployment is canonically identified as `${name}@${version}`.  |
| `description`  | (Optional) A short description of the squid  |

## `build:`

Specifies the way the squid is built into a docker image. Only an empty `build:` section is supported, and the squid must adhere
to the default [folder structure](/basics/squid-structure).

In particular, the following files and folders **must** be present in the root folder of the squid:

- `/db`
- `/src`
- `/assets` 
- `schema.graphql`
- `tsconfig.json` 
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json` 

Under the hood, Aquarium builds a Docker image and runs a docker container for each service (`api`, `processor`, `migrate`) using the same image. 
See [Troubleshooting](/deploy-squid/troubleshooting/#local-build) for instructions on how to build and run the image locally.

All the squid services (`api`, `processor`, `migrate`) use the same container image but with different commands.

## `deploy:`

The `deploy` section may define:

- `addons` Additional services deployed for the squid. 
  + `postgres` Deploys a Postgres 14 instance and injects `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT` env. variables to the squid services.
- `secrets` A list of secret names that must be provided by Aquarium. If any of the secrets is not defined, the deployment will fail
- `processor` The processor service of the squid. 
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container.
- `api` The API service of the squid.
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container. In particular, for the GraphQL API service, provide here additional flags to define [subscriptions](/graphql-api/subscriptions) or [caching](/graphql-api/caching)
- `migrate`: (Optional) The command to be run on squid init. **If not defined, `migrate` is executed with the default command.**
  + `cmd` (Optional) The command to be executed by the init container. Default: `['npx', 'squid-typorem-migration', 'apply']`.


The `migrate`, `processor` and `api` services may additionally define
- `env` (Optional) An key-value list of environment vairables to be added to the container runtime

## `scale:`

See the [Scale the deployment](/deploy-squid/scale) section.


## Examples

A minimal example of manifest is below:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My sample squid  

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
  processor:
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server"]
```

An extended version:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My advanced squid 

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
  # the set of secrets that must be set and provided by Aquarium
  secrets:
    - ACALA_RPC_ENDPOINT
    - COINGECKO_API_KEY 
  migrate:
    env:
      FOO: 
        bar
    cmd: ["echo", "skip migrations!"]
  processor:
    # additional env variables
    env:
      SQD_DEBUG: 
        sqd:mapping
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    env:
      SQD_DEBUG: 
        '*'
    # custom run command for the GraphQL server
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server", "--subscriptions", "--max-root-fields", "10", "--sql-statement-timeout", "1000" ] 

scale:
  addons:
     postgres:
         storage: 100G
         profile: medium
  processor:
     profile: medium
  api:
     profile: large
     # load-balance three replicas
     replicas: 3
```
